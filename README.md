# Mathematics Notes

## Overview

This is a repository for my Math notes. My notes will be digitalised in `LaTeX` and made readable in the `pdf` format. I do hope that whatever I place in this repository is correct and easy to follow.

This is mainly for me to refer to, and it will be catered to my understanding.
